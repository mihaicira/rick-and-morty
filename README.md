# Rick and Morty characters website

###### Job interview challenge for SensiDev

## Website details
The main purpose of the website is to present all characters from Rick and Morty TV Series.
 
The user is able to search the characters by their name and filter by their status: *dead*, *alive*, *unknown* or *all*.

The user recieves the results as pages, being able to navigate through them. One page displays a maximum of 20 characters.
Each character is has its own page where the user can find more informations about him.

It's also possible for the user to share the URL of any character by clicking on the clipboard icon that can be found both on the searching page and his own detailed page.

## 404 Handling
Error 404 is being handled in two different situations; either the character ID on its page raises an error or the whole URL path raises an error.

In both cases, a 404 image is showing.
